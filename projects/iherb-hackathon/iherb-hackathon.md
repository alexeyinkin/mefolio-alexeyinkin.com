A winning project for iHerb hackathon case.

["Leaders of Digital"](https://leadersofdigital.ru) is the largest hackathon in Russia. In 2021, [iHerb](https://iherb.com) was one of the case holders. I was a member of  [1DevFull team](https://1devfull.com). We took on that among 20+ other teams and [won the 3rd prize](https://leadersofdigital.ru/partner/740606) in this case.

The goal was to suggest a solution for more conscious consumption of supplements. Amid the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), people became obsessed with their health, and iHerb's sales skyrocketed with up to 5-fold increase in some regions. This overconsumption led to some overdoses and negative feedback. The goal was to decrease undesired consumption.

The solution was theorized to have a mobile app that tracks the user's activity using device sensors, recognizes blood test printouts, and uses A.I. to suggest supplements based on those inputs that are harmless and have no risk of OD, with some warnings on mutual exclusive items. The app was then to remind the user to take the supplements, to purchase more, and to re-take blood tests periodically.

The implementation was mostly hello-world stubs.

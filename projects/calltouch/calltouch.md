Calltouch is the leading call-tracking and ad analytic platform in Russia. It has over 25â€™000 corporate customers including half of the construction and car dealership markets. The company maintains dozens of servers with millions lines of code of their software.

I had been working there as a Senior PHP Developer for over a year.

Responsibilities:
- Auth system refactoring, finding and fixing security breaches.
- Ad report generation with lots of metrics and statistics from various external platforms, mapping large amounts of data.
- Notifications via Telegram Messenger.
- Configuring static code analysis with [phpstan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan), donated [a major feature code](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src/pull/196) to phpstan.
- Improving test coverage with Codeception.

When I was leaving, I was invited by the owner for an interview to another company of his. Must be showing I was doing well.

CoursePlease.com is my marketplace for photography teachers. It is currently under construction.

The backend is in PHP with MySQL. The frontend is made with Flutter and builds for Android, iOS and web from single code base. It relies on [Ably](https://ably.com) for event delivery.

This is the home page with a gallery of all teachers' works:

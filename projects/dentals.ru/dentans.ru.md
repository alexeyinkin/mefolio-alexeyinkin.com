Dental Studio is one of the leading dentistry clinics in Nizhny Novgorod, one of the
largest cities in Russia.

I had been making websites for them since 2010 till 2013. This is the first version:

I ended the support in 2012, and the new version was made by another studio.
Then in 2013 I did some minor improvement for them again.

I am grateful to Dental Studio because they were my first really famous customer,
so this job gave me a lot of credit. 
Before I never thought that famous companies are ruled by ordinary people just like us.
So this customer something special for me.

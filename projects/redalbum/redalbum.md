RedAlbum does school graduates photography. It operates in 22 cities of Russia and employs dozens of photographers and designers. On a website, customers can choose photos for each student and teacher, can comment on layout drafts, and submit the albums to a printing house.

The company had to scale and improve automation, and it was challenging with their legacy CMS. I did the following improvements for them:

- Continuous integration.
- Improved customer experience with an outline of what's expected of them on each step so as to reduce support requests.
- Text reminders and notifications on various actions.
- Payments and tax automation.
- Sorting and copying photos and videos on various stages of picking and approval.
- Expanded Google Calendar integration.
- An interface for designers to pick orders for processing.
- Tons of fixes including security.

This helped the company to survive the high season of 2022.

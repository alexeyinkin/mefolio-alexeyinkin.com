GetSoft.ru was a software marketplace before modern ones appeared. It was a website with PHP 4.3 backend and MySQL 3.23 database. I started it for myself as my first business. English version briefly existed at SoftLists.com.

In December 2003, I was probing free domain names. I stumbled upon getsoft.ru and registered it right away. Then I thought: "OK, I have a domain for a software marketplace. I guess I now have to make one".

By then I had been an immature game developer who was struggling to get somewhat 80 visitors a month on my homepage. I had been using early marketplaces and had a vision of what was inconvenient there. So I rushed to make my own one.

I only had HTML experience at the moment. So I found (a book on PHP)[https://vk.com/doc1798445_481149970?hash=7gb6d6j15YchtrcL6GB4GziYGGZdCzQPnVEiW8qWe3s&dl=1xaIDNo8wKMfWZ4cu62oj3fMh14MR9p1ceU0InNtkGX], read it, made and launched the website on March 4, 2004.

Among unique features for the time in the Russian market, it had:
- Alternative download links in case one breaks.
- Links for source code for open-source.
- Filters for platforms and license types.
- Configurable search that scanned titles, author names, and description.
- Pretty modern look.

I grabbed emails, names, and software titles from (download.ru)[https://web.archive.org/web/20040412033321/http://www.download.ru/], a most prominent competitor. I then sent thousands of automated personalized emails and got over 3000 software authors to sign up and publish their links on my marketplace.

All I had to do was vetting. I got decent organic traffic to that content. Monthly peak was 71'913 visitors in Jan 2010. Page views peaked at 175'856 in Dec 2007.

In the great recession of 2008, monetization ceased, so I lost interest. By the time markets recovered, peoples' habits on the internet changed. More advanced aggregators emerged, communication moved to social networks, and I was late to retain the audience. So I blew it.

On the 10th anniversary, on March 4, 2014, I publicly ended the project making the website read-only. It is now a museum. Feel free to walk the Jurassic Park.
